- **Student Bidding System**: Students bid on projects by showcasing their skills, approach, and availability, ensuring clients have a range of qualified candidates to choose from.
- **Alumni & Student Collaboration**: Clients select both a student and an alumni mentor for each project, ensuring knowledge transfer, support, and high-quality delivery.

### 2. Upskilling Students on Latest AI Tools
- **AI-Suggested Tech Stack**: When students describe their skill gaps, AI recommends the most relevant tech stack they need to learn.
- **Relevant Course Recommendations**: Based on the AI-recommended tech stack, relevant courses are displayed for students, helping them learn the necessary skills on the go.

### 3. Ensuring Quality in Student-Delivered Projects
- **Application-Based Bidding**: Students submit a week-by-week breakdown of their project execution plan when applying, ensuring they have a structured approach to the project.
